\section introduction Introduction
Libdigidocpp is the C++ library for OpenXAdES/DigiDoc system. It is a basic building tool for creating applications handling digital signatures, their creation and verification. The digitally signed files are created in “DigiDoc format“ (with .ddoc or .bdoc file extensions), compliant to XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES), technical standard published by European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI). 

\subsection about About DigiDoc
Libdigidocpp library forms a part of the wider OpenXAdES/DigiDoc system framework which offers a full-scale architecture for digital signature and documents, consisting of software libraries (C, C++ and Java), DigiDocService web service and end-user applications such as DigiDoc Portal and DigiDoc Client3 according to the following figure:

\image html digidoc_framework.png "DigiDoc framework"

It is easy to integrate DigiDoc components into existing applications in order to allow for creation, handling, forwarding and verification of digital signatures and support file encryption/decryption. All applications share common digitally signed file formats (current versions are BDOC 2.1 and DIGIDOC-XML 1.3).






\subsection format Format of digitally signed file
Actively used digitally signed file formats in DigiDoc system are:
- BDOC 2.1 - default format for new files in Libdigidocpp library, described in \ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013"; 
- DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 - see also \ref DDOC "DigiDoc format". NB! Libdigidocpp does not implement DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 support independently - it uses \ref CDigiDoc "CDigiDoc library" library as a base component (via a wrapper class) to offer support for the file format. 

DigiDoc system uses file extension .bdoc or .ddoc to distinguish digitally signed files according to the described file formats. Other historical formats that were used previously are SK-XML, DIGIDOC-XML 1.1, DIGIDOC-XML 1.2 and BDOC 1.0. 

The following chapters provides an overview of BDOC 2.1 digitally signed file format which is the preferred format for creating new signed documents in Libdigidocpp library. 



\subsubsection container BDOC container format
The ETSI standard TS 102 918 \ref ASiC "ASiC" called Associated Signature Containers (ASiC) defines format of container for encapsulation of signed files and signatures with extra information. The ETSI TS 103 174 \ref ASiC-BP "ASiC Baseline Profile" profiles in further on. The container type used in case of BDOC 2.1 documents is Associated Signature Extended form (ASiC-E).

ASiC-E container is a ZIP file consisting of the following objects:
- a file named “mimetype”, containing only the following value: application/vnd.etsi.asic-e+zip  
- data files in original format.
- META-INF subdirectory, consisting of:
	- manifest.xml – a file containing list of all folders and files in the container. The list does not contain the “mimetype” file and files in META-INF subdirectory.
	- signatures*.xml – one file for each signature, ‘*’ in the file’s name denotes the sequence number of a signature (counting starts from zero). The signatures*.xml file also incorporates certificates, validity confirmation and meta-data about the signer.

When BDOC 2.1 container is signed then all files in the container are signed, except of the mimetype file and files in META-INF subdirectory. 

Original files (which were signed) along with the signature(s), validation confirmation(s) and certificates are encapsulated within the container. As a result, it is possible to verify signature validity without any additional external information – the verifier should trust the issuer of signer’s certificate and the OCSP responder’s certificate. 

\image html asic.png "BDOC 2.1 container's contents"




\subsubsection profiles BDOC signature profiles

The format of the BDOC 2.1 digitally signed file is based on ETSI TS 101 903 standard called XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (\ref XAdES "XAdES"). The XAdES standard defines formats for advanced electronic signatures that remain valid over long periods of time. The ETSI standard TS 103 171 \ref XAdES-BP "XAdES Baseline Profile" further profiles the XAdES signature by putting limitations on choices. 

BDOC 2.1 specification defines two profiles of qualified BDOC signatures: BDOC with time-mark and BDOC with time-stamp. Both of the profiles offer long-term validation possibility by incorporating the necessary validation data in the signature. Both of the profiles are compliant to XAdES LT-Level requirements.


\paragraph BDOC-TM BDOC signature with time-mark
The BDOC signature with time-mark is based XAdES-EPES signature (Explicit Policy based Electronic Signature, see \ref XAdES "XAdES"). 

In order to offer long time validation, it is necessary to obtain proof of validity of the signer’s X.509 digital certificate issued by a certificate authority (CA) at the time of signature creation. In case of BDOC with time-marks (TM profile), the proof is obtained with a single OCSP response that has a specific “nonce” field’s value (i.e. the time-mark). 

The hash of the created signature (the &lt;SignatureValue&gt; element’s contents) is sent within the OCSP request’s and received back within the response’s “nonce” field. The OCSP request’s and response’s “nonce” field is a DER-encoding of the following ASN.1 data structure:
\code{.cpp}
	TBSDocumentDigest ::= SEQUENCE {
		algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
		digest OCTET STRING
	}
\endcode
The element digest is a hash value of the binary value of the &lt;SignatureValue&gt; element’s contents, element algorithm determines the used hash algorithm as defined in \ref RFC5280 "RFC 5280" clause 4.1.1.2. 

\note OCSP nonce field’s value is calculated differently in case of DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 and BDOC 2.1 formats. See the specification documents of these file formats for more information.

<b>The time-mark provides proof of the following:</b>
1. The signature value existed at a certain point of time (issuance time of the OCSP confirmation) – the verifier can calculate the hash of the signature and check its conformance to the OCSP response’s “nonce” field.
2. The signer’s certificate was valid (provided that the OCSP response is positive and does indeed confirm the certificate’s validity) at a certain point of time

It is important to notice that additional time-stamps are not necessary as time of signing and time of obtaining validity information is indicated in the OCSP response (i.e. the time-mark).

<b>NB!</b> The issuance time (producedAt field’s value) of the OCSP response (the time-mark) is regarded as the time of signature creation. 

To achieve long-time validity of digital signatures, a secure log system is employed within the model. All OCSP responses and changes in certificate validity are securely logged to preserve digital signature validity even after private key compromise of CA or OCSP responder. 

\image html security.png "Security model of time-marking mechanism"


\paragraph BDOC-TS BDOC signature with time-stamp

The BDOC signature with time-stamp is based on XAdES-BES signature (Basic Electronic Signature, see \ref XAdES).

In order to offer long time validation, it is necessary to obtaining proof of validity of the signer’s X.509 digital certificate issued by a certificate authority (CA) at the time of signature creation. 

In case of BDOC with time-stamp (TS profile), the proof is provided as follows:
1.	RCF3161 compliant time-stamp is obtained from a time-stamping service. The hash of the created signature (&lt;SignatureValue&gt; element block) is sent to the time-stamping server. The server’s response contains a time-stamp token with the same hash value that can later be used to validate that the time-stamp was indeed issued for the respective signature. The time-stamp token received from the server is added to the signature providing a proof from a trusted source that the signature value existed at a certain point of time.
2.	RFC 6960 compliant OCSP confirmation is obtained from an OCSP service. The OCSP response received from the server is used as a trusted source to confirm that the signer’s certificate was valid at a certain point of time (producedAt field’s value in the OCSP response). 
3.	The verifier must check the time-stamp token’s and OCSP confirmation’s time difference. If the difference is acceptable then it can stated that the signer’s certificate was valid at the time of signature creation.

<b>NB!</b> The issuance time (getTime field’s value) of the time-stamp token (received with the response from time-stamping server) is regarded as the time of signature creation.

Libdigidocpp is a library of C++ classes offering the functionality of handling digitally signed files in supported DigiDoc formats. The following functions are implemented:
- creating containers in supported DigiDoc formats and adding data files;
- creating digital signatures using smart cards or other supported cryptographic tokens;
- adding time marks and validity confirmations to digital signatures using OCSP and time-stamping protocols; 
- validating the digital signatures;
- using trust service status lists (TSL) as trust anchors for certificate validation;
- extracting data files from a container;
- removing signatures and data files from a container.

The following table gives overview of functional features that are supported with Libdigidocpp.
<table>
<tr>
  <th>Feature</th>
  <th>Supported values</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>DigiDoc document format</td>
  <td>
- BDOC 2.1 - the main document format to be used, described in \ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013".
- DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 – alternative supported file format, described in \ref DDOC "DigiDoc format". Note that using BDOC 2.1 format is preferred for new documents. 
\note - DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 support has been added to Libdicidocpp via CDigiDoc library (the C library of DigiDoc system, see \ref CDigiDoc "CDigiDoc Programmer's Guide"). Note that the document format is tested in Libdigidocpp indirectly via DigiDoc3 Client desktop application which uses the library as a base layer. 

\note - Older DigiDoc file formats SK-XML, DIGIDOC-XML 1.1 and DIGIDOC-XML 1.2 are supported only for backward compatibility in case of digital signature verification and data file extraction operations (creating new files and modifying existing files is not supported).

\note - BDOC 1.0 file format is not supported (files in this format are recognized by the library but handling the files is not supported).
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Signature profile</td>
<td>Signature profiles are based on the profiles defined by XAdES (\ref XAdES "XAdES").
- TM - the default profile, certificate validity and signing time information is added to the signature with a time-mark - a special OCSP confirmation in case of which the hash value of the binary value of the signature (along with hash algorithm identifier in case of BDOC 2.1 document format) must be present in the “nonce” field of the OCSP confirmation. In this case, signature creation time is regarded as the issuance time of the OCSP confirmation (producedAt value in the confirmation), additional time-stamp token is not required. 
- TS - signature profile in case of which the certificate validity information is added to the signature with an OCSP confirmation; the signing time information is added with a time-stamp token (see also \ref RFC6960 "RFC6960") retrieved from a time-stamping service. In this case, signature creation time is regarded as the issuance time of the time-stamp token (genTime value in the time-stamp). The profile is supported only in case of BDOC 2.1 document format, the “SignatureTimeStamp” element is added to the signature (see also \ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013"). Supported since v3.9 of the library.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Trust anchors</td>
<td>Information of trusted CA certificates (trust anchors) is used to validate the trustworthiness of certificates used in the signature. The signer certificate's CA, OCSP responder certificate and time-stamping service's certificate (in case of TS signature profile) must be trusted. Trusted certificates' information is obtained from one of the following sources, depending on the signature format and build settings of the library.
- BDOC 2.1 document format: TSL list (Trust Service status list) - the default source of trusted certificates, the trusted certificates' list is retrieved from a signed TSL list that provides information about the status and the status history of the trust services (including certification, OCSP confirmation and time-stamping services). The European Commission's TSL list is used, more information of which can be found from https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/. For the TSL specification document, see also \ref TSL "Trusted Lists". For more information about the TSL implementation and configuration possibilities in Libdigidocpp library, see \ref TSL-overview and \ref CA-settings. The TSL functionality is supported since v3.9 of the library. 
- DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 document format: the trusted certificates are loaded from digidoc.ini configuration file. See \ref CDigiDoc "CDigiDoc Programmer's Guide" for more information.

<b>Schema ts_102918v010201.xsd</b>

1) The namespace value has been changed as the initial value in the original schema was incorrect. The value in original schema will be corrected with the next version of the ASiC standard.
\code{.xml}

2) The schema’s location has been altered so that the imported schema file is looked up from the local file system.
\code{.xml}
<xsd:import namespace="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"
schemaLocation="xmldsig-core-schema.xsd"/> <!-- originally "http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xmldsig-core-20020212/xmldsig-core-schema.xsd" -->
\endcode

<b>Schema xmldsig-core-schema.xsd</b>

1) The XMLSchema.dtd reference has been commented out due to implementation issues (otherwise a warning message would be produced).   
\code{.xml}
<!--
<!DOCTYPE schema

-->
\endcode
2) The initial integer data type used in the original schema is converted into long data type when generating C++ source code from the current schema. However, as the SK issued certificates’ serial numbers are too long to fit into long type variable then the data type has been changed to string.
\code{.xml}

\section conf Configuring Libdigidocpp

\tableofcontents
The following subchapters describe configuration settings for handling <B>BDOC 2.1</B> files via the Libdigidocpp library's core functionality. Information about applying configuration settings for DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 files (via the CDigiDoc library) has been provided in \ref CDigiDoc "CDigiDoc Programmer's Guide".

\subsection loading Loading configuration settings
Libdigidocpp uses XML configuration file named digidocpp.conf. Configuration file's structure is defined with XML schema "conf.xsd" - the file is included in etc/schema/ subdirectory of Libdigidocpp package. For a sample configuration file, see \ref sample-conf.

It is possible to use two types of configuration files: global and user's file. Global file can be used to determine system-wide settings that cannot be altered by a user's file – it can be done separately for each parameter in the file by setting the parameter's "lock" attribute value to "true". User's file can be used to determine user-specific parameter values. 

It is possible to use only one configuration file (either global or user's file) or two files in parallel. In the latter case, the matching user file's parameter entries overwrite global file's entries, if the respective parameter is not defined as locked in the global file.

By default, the configuration file's settings are loaded during the library's initialization – Libdigidocpp looks for global and user configuration files from their default locations depending on the environment:
- in case of Windows environment:
	- the global configuration file is looked up from the directory where digidocpp.dll library file is located. If the directory doesn't contain /schema subdirectory then the configuration file is looked up from the current working directory.
	- user configuration file is looked up from the system directory containing application data for the current user: %APPDATA%\\digidocpp\\digidocpp.conf
- in case of OS X:
	- the global configuration file is looked up from a location in the file system: digidocpp.framework/Resources/digidocpp.conf
	- user configuration file is looked up from $HOME/.digidocpp/digidocpp.conf
- in case of Linux environment: 
	- the global configuration file is looked up from a location in the file system: /etc/digidocpp/digidocpp.conf
	- user configuration file is looked up from $HOME/.digidocpp/digidocpp.conf

It is also possible to load global configuration file from a non-default location. In this case, call out the configuration file's initialization method before initializing the library:
\code{.cpp}
	// Initialize global configuration settings from a non-default location
	digidoc::Conf::init(new digidoc::XmlConfV2("<file-path-and-name>"));
	// then initialize the library
	digidoc::initialize();
\endcode
Local configuration settings can also be set or modified during runtime by calling out the respective set methods of XmlConfV2 class. 
The digidoc::XMLConfV2 class (supported since v3.9 of the library) must be used in order for the TSL and time-stamp configuration settings to be supported. Otherwise, the older XMLConf class can be used.

\subsection parameters Configuration parameters
Configuration file's elements and their attribute names are defined in conf.xsd file. 
Below is a description of the configuration file's parameters. The attribute "lock", when set to "true" can optionally be used to determine parameter values which should not be overwritten by another configuration file (e.g. when using global and user's configuration files in parallel; see also the previous section for more information).

</td>
</tr>
</table>

\subsubsection CA-settings Trust anchor settings 
Information of trusted CA certificates (trust anchors) is used to validate the trustworthiness of certificates used in the signature during signing and signature validation processes. The signer certificate's CA, OCSP responder certificate and time-stamping service's (TSA) certificate must be trusted. 

By default, the trusted certificates' information is obtained from European Commission's TSL list (https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml) (see also \ref TSL-overview and \ref TSL "TSL standard" for more information). The default TSL behaviour can be changed by altering the configuration parameters listed below. 

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Parameter name</th>
  <th>Comments</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>tsl.autoupdate</td>
  <td>Determines if TSL validity is checked during every initialization of the library and if new TSL lists are downloaded if the existing list is expired. By default, the automatic update functionality is enabled and can be disabled by setting the parameter's value to "false". Note that when setting the parameter to "false" then you should copy the necessary TSL files to the "tsl.cache" location manually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>tsl.cache</td>
  <td>Directory in the file system where the TSL lists are saved and read in by the library. Set this parameter with your own value to change the default directories:

</table>

\subsubsection ocspsigning-settings Settings for signing OCSP requests
Whether you need to sign the OCSP requests sent to your OCSP responder or not depends on your responder. Some OCSP servers require that the OCSP request is signed. To sign the OCSP request, you need to obtain and specify the certificates, which will be used for signing.

For example, accessing the SK's OCSP Responder service by private persons requires the requests to signed (access certificates can be obtained through registering for the service ) whereas in case of companies/services, signing the request is not required if having a contract with SK and accessing the service from specific IP address(es). It is not necessary to sign OCSP requests in case of using OCSP test-responder (see the next sub-section for more information).

By default, the parameter "pkcs12.disable" value is set to "true" – i.e. the OCSP requests will not be signed. If setting this to "false", you will also need to provide your access certificate file's location and password that have been issued to you for this purpose.

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Parameter name</th>
  <th>Comments</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>pkcs12.disable</td>
  <td>Specifies if the OCSP requests are signed or not. Possible values are: 
true – OCSP requests are not signed; 
false – OCSP requests are signed. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>pkcs12.cert</td>
  <td>Specifies your access certificate's PKCS#12 container's filename, e.g. ./home/132936.p12d</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>pkcs12.pass</td>
  <td>Specifies your access certificate's PKCS#12 container's  password, e.g. m15eTGpA</td>
</tr>
</table>




\subsubsection ocspresponder-settings OCSP responder settings

The default OCSP responder that the library uses for retrieving the OCSP confirmation during signature creation depends on the signer's certificate chain:
- in case of SK's live certificates: the SK's live OCSP responder http://ocsp.sk.ee is used
- in case of certificates issued by Finnish, Latvian and Lithuanian CAs: the SK's proxy OCSP responder http://ocsp.sk.ee/_proxy is used

In case of SK's test certificates, the SK's test OCSP responder http://www.openxades.org/cgi-bin/ocsp.cgi is used by default.

You change the default behaviour in the configuration file with the following parameter. 

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Parameter name</th>
  <th>Comments</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>ocsp issuer</td>
  <td>The "issuer" parameter's name stands for the signer certificate issuer's Common Name (CN) value, e.g. ESTEID-SK 2007. The element's value specifies OCSP responder server's URL address that is used for certificates issued from the respective CA chain. 
</td>

\section usage Using Libdigidocpp API

\tableofcontents
Note that Libdigidocpp uses internal memory buffers in case of all the operations, so that intermediary data is not written to temporary files on the disk. Also, the data files to be added to a DigiDoc container can be read from a data stream and later extracted from the container to a stream so that the data can be kept in memory.

\subsection initialization Initialization
Libdigidocpp's initialization method conducts the following operations: 
1. initializes dependent libraries (see also \ref libraries)
2. loads configuration settings from default configuration files 
3. initializes trust anchors: initializes TSL lists (if TSL support is enabled in the library and USE_TSL build parameter has been set during build time). See \ref TSL-init for more information about the TSL initialization process.


If you would like to use non-default configuration settings then call out the configuration file's initialization before initializing the library, for example:
\code{.cpp}
    // Optionally initialize global configuration file to use non-default settings
    digidoc::Conf::init(new digidoc::XmlConfV2("<file-path-and-name>"));
    // Initialize the library
    digidoc::initialize();
\endcode

The digidoc::XMLConfV2 class (supported since v3.9 of the library) must be used in order for the TSL and time-stamp configuration settings to be supported. Otherwise, the older XMLConf class can be used.





\subsection creating Creating and signing a DigiDoc document

\subsubsection containercreate Creating a DigiDoc container
Create a new container object and specify the DigiDoc document's type, for example:
\code{.cpp}
    digidoc::Container doc(digidoc::Container::AsicType); // create new BDOC 2.1 container
\endcode
Container class is used to incorporate the data of a DigiDoc document.




\subsubsection adddatafile Adding data files
Data files can be added to a DigiDoc container in two alternative ways:
1. adding the data from an input stream (i.e. the data file contents can be read from internal memory buffer):
\code{.cpp}
    void digidoc::Container::addDataFile(std::istream *is, // input stream
    const std::string &fileName, // file name that is written to the container
    const std::string &mediaType); // mime type of the data file
\endcode
2. adding the data by reading the it from file system
\code{.cpp}
    void digidoc::Container::addDataFile(const std::string &path, //data file's name and path in file system
    const std::string &mediaType); // mime type of the data file
\endcode

Parameter mediaType in the methods above stands for a MIME type of the data file, for example "text/plain" or "application/msword". Value "application/octet-stream" is used by default.
Calling out any of the methods listed above shall create a new DataFile object and add it to the DigiDoc container's data file collection.
Note that in order to add a data file to a container, the container has to be unsigned and there shouldn't be an existing data file with the same name in the container. If a container is signed then it is possible to add data files to it only after the signatures are removed.

\warning In case of BDOC 2.1 documents, it is important to pay attention that the data file's mime type value in manifest.xml file and in signatures*.xml file's &lt;DataObjectFormat&gt;&lt;MimeType&lt; element are the same, otherwise the signature is invalid! In case of the ordinary signature creation process, the library sets the correct value automatically. However, if you create a BDOC 2.1 container with Libdigidocpp library and want to add signatures*.xml file that you have received from another source (e.g. from DigiDocService) then make sure that the data files' mime-type values in manifest-xml file and in signatures*.xml file are the same.






\subsubsection API-add-sign Adding signatures
It is possible to add a signature to a container only if it contains at least one data file, multiple signatures can be added to a single container. The signer's certificate and PIN code to access the private signature key are required during signing.



To start adding signatures, firstly declare pointer to the Signature object to be created:
\code{.cpp}
    digidoc::Signature *signature = 0;
\endcode

Signing can be done by using PKCS#11 module for accessing the signature token. PKCS#11 module is the default module for singing with smart card (e.g. Estonian ID card or any other smart card provided that you have the external native language PKCS#11 driver for it).
\code{.cpp}
    digidoc::PKCS11Signer *signer = new digidoc::PKCS11Signer("<PKCS11-driver-path>");
    // optionally specify PKCS#11 driver's location. If left  unspecified then location is
    // looked up from configuration file's parameter "pkcs11.driver.path".
	std::string pin = "<pin-code>"; //PIN2 in case of Estonian ID cards
    signer->setPin(pin); 
\endcode
If you would like to add PIN insertion dialog window for the signer to enter the PIN code then you can write a new class which extends the PKCS11Signer class, overwrite the std::string pin(const X509Cert &cert) method and write your own PIN dialog implementation code there.


\paragraph API-sign-data Optionally specify additional signer's data
Signature production place and signer role are optional signed meta-data about the signature. If left unspecified then the respective elements in the signatures*.xml file are created with no contents.
\code{.cpp}
    std::string city, state, postalCode, country;
    std::vector<std::string> roles;
    signer->setSignatureProductionPlace(city, state, postalCode, country); // location where the signature is created
    signer->setSignerRoles(roles); // role(s) of the signer
\endcode


\paragraph API-sign-create Specify the signature profile and create the signature
The supported signature profiles are (see also \ref Supported, under "Signature profiles"):
- "time-mark" - the default profile, certificate validity and signing time information is added to the signature with a time-mark (an OCSP confirmation with a specific "nonce" value). Signature creation time is the time-mark's issuance time (i.e. the OCSP confirmation's producedAt field's value).
- "time-stamp" - signature profile in case of which the certificate validity information is added to the signature with an OCSP confirmation (retrieved from OCSP server); the signing time information is added with a time-stamp token (retrieved from a time-stamping service). Signature creation time is the issuance time of the time-stamp token (value of the getTime field in the token). The profile is supported only in case of BDOC 2.1 document format, since v3.9 of the library.

The signing method also adds validation data from external services (OCSP and/or time-stamping servers). Note that the OCSP responder and time-stamping server settings (in case of TS profile) should be configured before calling out the following method (see also \ref initialization and \ref parameters). Note that by default, there is no time-stamping service support configured.

\code{.cpp}
std::string profile = "<signature-profile>"; // "time-mark" or "time-stamp"
signature = doc.sign(signer, profile);
\endcode



\paragraph validatesig Validating the created signatures
After the signature has been added to the container, it should be validated before writing the signed container to an output file. For validating the signature, do as follows:
\code{.cpp}
    signature->validate();
\endcode
The validation method above validates the signed data files', signer certificate's and OCSP confirmation's correspondence to the signature value. Note that the validation method above does not validate other signatures which may belong to the same container.

\subsection containeropen Reading and writing DigiDoc documents
In order to read an existing DigiDoc file from the file system, do as follows:
\code{.cpp}
    digidoc::Container doc("<input-file's-path>");
\endcode
The method above reads in the DigiDoc file from the specified location in file system and
creates the respective Container object representing the document's data. The file's structure
is also validated during its parsing according to the corresponding standards (see also for <a href="http://id.ee/public/DigiDoc_format_1.3.pdf">DIGIDOC XML 1.3</a> documents and for <a href="https://www.sk.ee/repository/bdoc-spec21.pdf">BDOC 2.1</a> documents).

Write a DigiDoc file (represented with a Container object) to file system with the following method:
\code{.cpp}
    doc.save("<output-file's-path>");
\endcode

\subsection validate Validating signatures
Validation of a signed DigiDoc document consists of three main steps:
1.	Call out the main validation method of the library. If there are multiple validation errors then get the errors list.
2.	Check for additional errors/warnings (separate implementation);
3.	Determine the validation status of the document (according to the returned error codes and validation status priorities).

\subsubsection main-method Using the main validation method
You can validate a signature and its validation data - OCSP confirmation and time-stamp (in case of TS profile) - with method: 
\code{.cpp}
void digidoc::Signature::validate();
\endcode
If an exception is thrown from the validation method then the signature can be either <b>INVALID</b> or <b>VALID WITH WARNINGS</b>; otherwise the signature is VALID. Before determining the final validation status, additional errors must be checked, as described in the following chapters.

If an exception is thrown then its causes can be retrieved with the following method:
\code{.cpp}
vector<digidoc::Exception> digidoc::Exception::causes();
\endcode

\subsubsection additional Checking for additional errors/warnings
There are validation cases that are not checked in the default validation method of the library, instead, separate methods for checking the specific situations have to be implemented by the library’s user. In Libdigidocpp library, checking for a test signature and old file format must be done separately. 

The following subchapters describe how these checks can be implemented. After checking for additional errors/warnings, collect all of the error codes and continue with determining the validation status as described in the next chapter.

\paragraph test-signature Checking for test signature
Test signature is a signature that has been created by using test certificates (e.g. signer’s certificate and/or OCSP responder server’s certificate have been issued for testing purposes).

Sample code for checking for test signature can be found from digidoc-tool.cpp utility program, method: 
\code{.cpp}
open(int argc, char* argv[]); //utility program’s command “open”
\endcode
For identifying if a certificate is a SK issued test certificate, you can use the following method as a sample code:
\code{.cpp}
type(const X509Cert &cert);
\endcode
The identification is done with comparing certificate policy OID values.


\paragraph old-format Checking for old file formats
Sample for checking old versions can be found from two sources.
1.	 CDigiDoc library’s utility program’s source code in cdigidoc.c source file, method 
\code{.cpp}
cmdReadDigiDoc(SignedDoc** ppSigDoc, DEncEncryptedData** ppEncData, int nMode); //utility program’s command -in
\endcode
The check for old file formats is implemented in method:
\code{.cpp}
 checkOldFormatVer(SignedDoc* pSigDoc);
 \endcode
2.	It is possible to check the source code of DigiDoc3 Client desktop application, accessible from https://svn.eesti.ee/projektid/idkaart_public/trunk/qdigidoc/.


\subsubsection validation-status Determining the validation status
After validating the signed DigiDoc document, the validation result must be determined by the library's user. Final validation result must be one of the possible validation statuses that are described in the table below, the status must be chosen according to its priority.
The validation status priorities have to be applied in two cases:
1. <b>Returning a validation result of a single signature:</b><br>
If there are more than one validation errors that occur when validating a single signature in DigiDoc container then the overall status of the signature should be chosen according to the status priorities.
2. <b>Returning a validation result of the whole DigiDoc container:</b><br>
If there are more than one signatures in a DigiDoc container and the signatures have different validation statuses or validation of the container structure returns a different status then the overall status of the DigiDoc file should be chosen according to the status priorities.

<b>NB! User of the library has to determine the validation status according to the error code that is returned by the library's validation method.</b>

\endcode

\paragraph validatewarnings Validation status VALID WITH WARNINGS
In special cases, validation errors can be regarded as minor technical errors and the file's validation status can be regarded as VALID WITH WARNINGS instead.

\warning User of the DigiDoc library has to decide on his/her own when to use VALID WITH WARNINGS status instead of INVALID: there may be different interpretations of the severity of validation errors in different information systems then the final decision when to use this
status has to be made by the library's user according to the requirements of the specific information system.

It is recommended to use the validation status VALID WITH WARNINGS in case of the error situations that are included in the table below - these error situations are regarded as VALID WITH WARNINGS in DigiDoc applications and software libraries, including:
- DigiDoc3 Client desktop application,
- JDigiDoc, Libdigidocpp and CDigiDoc software libraries' utility programs.

\subsubsection validation-info	Additional information about validation
\paragraph validation-overview Overview of validation activities
Overview of validation activities is as follows: 
1.	checking that all the data files and signature’s meta-data (signer’s role, etc.) are included in the signature by calculating the data objects’ digest values and comparing them with the &lt;Reference&gt; element values in the signature; 
2.	checking that the claimed signer’s certificate is the actual certificate that was used for signing; checking that the “Non-repudiaton” value is set in the “Key Usage” extension of the signer’s certificate;
3.	checking that the signature value is correct by decrypting the value with the signer’s public key and comparing the result with digest calculated from &lt;SignedInfo&gt; element block;
4.	checking that the OCSP response confirms the signer certificate’s validity and corresponds to the signature value (by comparing the digest value of &lt;SignatureValue&gt; element’s value and OCSP response’s nonce value);
5.	checking that the signer’s and OCSP responder’s certificates are trusted (i.e. the certificates’ issuers are registered in trust store).


\subsection extracting Extracting data files
A data file can be extracted from container and written to the specified location in the file system or to an output stream. 
1.	You can write the data file to a stream and keep it in memory:
\code{.cpp}
void digidoc::DataFile::saveAs(std::ostream &os);
\endcode

2.	The file can be written to file system with the following method:
\code{.cpp}
void digidoc::DataFile::saveAs(const std::string& path);
\endcode

List of all the document’s data files can be retrieved with the following method:
\code{.cpp}
DataFileList digidoc::Container::dataFiles();
\endcode

For example, read in a DigiDoc document and write its data files to file system as follows: 
\code{.cpp}
digidoc::Container doc("<input-file’s-path>"); // read in a document 
digidoc::DataFileList files = doc.dataFiles(); // get the data files’ list

for(DataFileList::const_iterator i = files.begin(); i != files.end(); ++i){
	try {
		std::string dst = i->fileName(); // get the data file’s name
		i->saveAs(dst); // save the data file to working directory
	} catch(const digidoc::Exception &e) {
		printf("  Document %s extraction: FAILED\n", i->fileName().c_str());
	}
}
\endcode

\subsection removing Removing signatures and data files
In order to remove a signature from DigiDoc document, use the following method:
\code{.cpp}
void digidoc::Container::removeSignature(unsigned int id); 
\endcode

Data files can be removed from a container only after all of its signatures have been removed. Use the following method to remove a data file from DigiDoc container:
\code{.cpp}
void digidoc::Container::removeDataFile(unsigned int id);
\endcode

“Id” parameters of the abovementioned methods represent the signature’s and data file’s sequence numbers in the container. The identifiers are determined when a data file or signature is added to the container, counting starts from zero. 
\note The functionality of modifying files in DigiDoc file formats SK-XML, DIGIDOC-XML 1.1, DIGIDOC-XML 1.2 and BDOC 1.0 is not supported.


\subsection shutting-down Shutting down the library
After finishing work with Libdigidocpp, then the last task is to shut down the library:
\code{.cpp}
digidoc::terminate();
\endcode

The termination method closes libraries used in Libdigidocpp implementation and deletes temporary files that may have been written to disk when working with the library.

\subsection exceptions Exception handling
The Libdigidocpp library may throw exceptions that are instances of Exception class (defined in Exception.h source file). The code which uses Libdigidocpp’s API should be wrapped in a try/catch block as follows: 
\code{.cpp}
try { 

// code implementation

} catch(const digidoc::Exception &e) {  
    printf("Exception:%s\n", parseException(e).c_str()); // Sample exception 
  							// handling method
}
\endcode

An Exception instance thrown by the library may contain a stack trace of the hierarchy of exceptions. For example, to parse the whole stack trace, do as follows: 
\code{.cpp}
std::string parseException(const digidoc::Exception &e)
{
    std::string result = e.msg() + "\n"; // the error message is retrieved
    digidoc::Exception::Causes list = e.causes(); // list of exceptions in lower level 
    // Iteration through the list of causes:
    for(digidoc::Exception::Causes::const_iterator i = list.begin(); i != list.end(); ++i)
        result += parseException(*i); // Parsing the exceptions recursively
    return result; // The error message is returned
}
\endcode


\section utility Libdigidocpp utility program

The command line utility program digidoc-tool.exe which is included in the Libdigidocpp distribution can be used to test the library or simply use it directly to handle digitally signed documents.
The general format for executing the program is:
\code{.txt}
> digidoc-tool [command] [options] [input/output file]
\endcode

\subsection	Creating Creating and signing a document

Command “create” can be used to create a new DigiDoc container, add data files, optionally some meta-info about the signer and sign the document. Documents can be created only in BDOC 2.1 format.
General form of the command is:
\code{.txt}
> digidoc-tool create --file=<data-file> <output-bdoc-file>
\endcode 

Available options:
<table>
<tr><td>
--file=	</td><td>Required

Data file(s) to be signed. The option can occur multiple times. 
</td></tr><tr><td>
--mime=	</td><td>Optional

Specifies the data file's mime-type value. When used then must be written right after the "--file" parameter. If left unspecified then the default mime-type value "application/octet-stream" is used.
</td></tr>
</table>

Additional options for the "create" command are the same as for "sign" command (see \ref Adding).

Sample commands for creating and signing DigiDoc files:

\code{.txt}
Sample: creating new BDOC file, adding multiple data files and signing via PKCS#11 driver
> digidoc-tool create --file=file1.txt --mime=text/plain --file=file2.pdf --mime=application/pdf --country=Estonia 
--state=Harjumaa --city=Tallinn --postalCode=12345 --pkcs11 demo-container.bdoc

Input:
  - file1.txt 			- a data file to be added to container
  - text/plain			- data file mime-type
  - file2.pdf			- a data file to be added to container	
  - application/pdf		- data file mime-type
  - Estonia			- country where the signature is created
  - Harjumaa			- county where the signature is created
  - Tallinn			- city where the signature is created
  - 12345			- postal code of the signature creation location
  - --pkcs11			- signing is done via PKCS#11 module
  - demo-container.bdoc	- container to be created (in BDOC2.0 format)
\endcode

\code{.txt}
Sample: creating new BDOC file, adding data file and signing via CNG API
> digidoc-tool create --file=file1.txt --cng demo-container.bdoc 

Input:
  - file1.txt 			- a data file to be added to container
  - --cng			- CNG API is used for signing
  - demo-container.bdoc	- container to be created (in BDOC2.0 format)
\endcode

\code{.txt}
Sample: creating new BDOC file, adding data file and signing via CNG API, dialog windows for certificate selection and PIN insertion are not displayed
> digidoc-tool create --file=file1.txt --cng --selectFirst --pin=01497 demo-container.bdoc 

Input:
  - file1.txt 			- a data file to be added to container
  - --cng			- CNG API is used for signing
  - --selectFirst	- the first signing certificate in store is used for signing
  - 01497			- PIN code (PIN2 in case of Estonian ID cards)
  - demo-container.bdoc	- container to be created (in BDOC2.0 format)
\endcode

\subsection	Opening Opening document, validating signatures and extracting data files
Command “open” enables to read in an existing DigiDoc document, print out a list of its contents and validate signatures. By specifying the additional option --extractaAll, then the data files are extracted from the container and stored on the disk. All DigiDoc file formats are supported with this command (except of BDOC1.0).
General form of the command is:
\code{.txt}
> digidoc-tool open <input-container-file> 
\endcode

Available options:
<table>
<tr><td>
--extractAll	</td><td>Optional

If set, then all of the input container’s data files are extracted and written to disk. If an output directory is not specified with the value of this parameter then the extracted files are written to the same directory where the input file is located. 
</td></tr><tr><td>
--warnings=
(ignore, warnings, error)	</td><td>Optional

Enables to choose the displaying of validation warnings (if present) of the file being opened. Can be used to test the warnings system of the utility program (see also “Validation status VALID WITH WARNINGS”). 
The options include:
-	warnings – the default value used. The minor technical errors that are considered as warnings, are printed out as warnings.
-	 error – the errors that are otherwise considered as warnings (by the utility program), are printed out as errors. 
-	ignore – the errors that are otherwise considered as warnings (by the utility program), are not printed out. If there are any other errors present then these are treated as usual.
</td></tr>
</table>

Output of the default command contains the following data of the container:
\code{.txt}
  Container type: <container’s mime-type>
  Documents (<number of data files in container>):
    Document (<data file’s mime-type>): <file’s name> (<file’s size> bytes)
  Signatures (<number of signatures in container>):
    Signature <signature’s sequence number> (<signature’s profile>):
      Validation: <signature validation result: OK/FAILED>
      EPES policy: urn:oid: <signature policy identifier OID> 
      SPUri: <URL to the BDOC 2.1 specification document>
      Signature method: <signature method URI> 
      Signing time: <signing time according to computer’s settings (not the     
             official signing time)>
      Signing cert: <subject CN field’s value>
      Produced At: <time of OCSP response’s issuance, i.e. official signing time>
      OCSP Responder: <OCSP responder certificate CN field’s value>
      OCSP Nonce (<length in bytes>): <OCSP responses nonce field’s value (has to 
            correspond to the &lt;SignatureValue&gt; element’s hash)>
      Warnings: <possible validation related warnings (see explanation below)>
\endcode

\note By default, if the signature validation process discovered errors that are regarded as minor technical errors in digidoc-tool.cpp utility program then the document is considered as VALID WITH WARNINGS, the errors are printed out as warnings to the end user. See also chapter \ref validation-status.

\subsection	Adding Adding signatures
Command “sign” enables adding signatures to existing DigiDoc containers. The supported DigiDoc document formats are DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 and BDOC 2.1.
\code{.txt}
> digidoc-tool sign <modified-digidoc-container> 
\endcode

<table>
<tr><td>
--pin=	</td><td>Optional

If PIN is not provided with this parameter value and (the default) PKCS#11 module is used for signing then the utility program asks for the user to insert PIN code to command line during the program’s execution time.
</td></tr><tr><td>
--profile=	</td><td>Optional

Profile of the signature. Possible values are: 
- TM - a time-mark will be added to the signature as validation data; 
- TS - a time-stamp and OCSP confirmation will be added to the signature as validation data.
</td></tr><tr><td>
--city=	</td><td>Optional

City where the signature is created.
</td></tr><tr><td>
--state=	</td><td>Optional

State or province where the signature is created.
</td></tr><tr><td>
--postalCode=	</td><td>Optional

Postal code of the place where the signature is created.
</td></tr><tr><td>
--country=	</td><td>Optional

Country of origin. ISO 3166-type 2-character country codes are used (e.g. EE)
</td></tr><tr><td>
--role=	</td><td>Optional

Signer’s role(s). The option can occur multiple times.
</td></tr><tr><td>
--sha(1,224,
256,384,512)	</td><td>Optional

Used for testing purposes. Specifies the hash function that is used for calculating digest values. If not specified then SHA-256 is used by default.
</td></tr>
</table>


Options for specifying module used for accessing the signing token - possible alternatives are PKCS#11, CryptoAPI/CNG and PKCS#12 (for testing purposes). When signing module is not specified then PKCS#11 module is used by default. 
<table>
<tr><td>
--pkcs11[=]	</td><td>Optional

Signing is done via PKCS#11 module - the default module for singing with smart card in Linux and OS X. When signing via PKCS#11 module then the parameter’s value can be used to specify the path and filename of PKCS#11 driver in your file system. For example, “opensc-pkcs11.dll” in Windows environment and “opensc-pkcs11.so” in Linux and OSX.
If the parameter’s value is left unspecified then PKCS#11 driver’s location is looked up from configuration file (see also chap. \ref parameters).
</td></tr><tr><td>
--cng  	</td><td>Optional

Set the parameter to sign via Microsoft CNG API (in Windows environment). If “--pin” parameter’s value is not set then PIN insertion dialog is displayed to the user. Parameter “--cng” may optionally be used along with parameter “--selectFirst”.
</td></tr><tr><td>
--selectFirst  	</td><td>Optional

Additional parameter that can optionally be used along with parameter “–cng”. When the parameter is set then the first certificate in Windows certificate store is chosen for signature creation. If the parameter is not set then certificate selection dialog window is displayed to user.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
--pkcs12=	</td><td>Optional

Signing is done via PKCS#12 module - can be used for testing purposes, currently has been used for testing signature creation with ECC keys. Enables to use a PKCS#12 software token (containing the signing certificate and private key) for signature creation. Note that the created signature is not a valid signature and it is not equal to handwritten signature as the PKCS#12 software token is not considered a secure signature creation device.
</td></tr>
</table>

- demo-container.bdoc		- container to be modified
\endcode

\code{.txt}
Sample: adding a signature via CNG API
> digidoc-tool sign --cng demo-container.bdoc

\endcode


\subsection	Removing Removing signatures and data files
Signatures and data files can be removed from a DigiDoc container with the command “remove”. Note that it is possible to remove data files only from an unsigned container (i.e all signatures must be removed before removing data files). The command is supported with DigiDoc formats DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 and BDOC 2.1.
General format of the command is:
\code{.txt}
> digidoc-tool remove --document=<doc-id> --signature=<sig-id> <modified-digidoc-container>
\endcode

Available options:
<table>
<tr><td>
--document=	</td><td>Optional

Specifies the sequence number of the data file that is removed from the container. The sequence numbers are counted from zero.
</td></tr><tr><td>
--signature=	</td><td>Optional

Specifies the sequence number of the signature that is removed from the container. The sequence numbers are counted from zero.
</td></tr>
</table>
Sample commands for removing signatures and data files:
\code{.txt}
Sample: removing signature from container
> digidoc-tool remove --signature=1 demo-container.bdoc

Input:
- 1				- sequence number of the signature that is removed

\subsection	TSL-tool Validating TSL and printing its diagnostics
The "tsl" enables to validate the correctness and print out the diagnostics of the TSL lists used by the Libdigidocpp library during BDOC 2.1 signature creation and validation processes. See \ref TSL-overview and \ref CA-settings for more information.

General format of the command is:
\code{.txt}
> digidoc-tool tsl 
\endcode





\section supported-tokens National and cross-border support

\subsection TSL-overview TSL lists
In case of BDOC 2.1 documents, Libdigidocpp library uses Trust Service status Lists (TSL) as trust anchors. TSL lists are a standardized way to add support for cross-border trust-service providers, e.g. CA's that issue qualified certificates, OCSP service and time-stamping service providers (see also \ref TSL "TSL specification"). TSL list is a digitally signed a document in XML format, the list is accompanied with a TSL signing certificate that is used to validate the list's signature.

Libdigidocpp library uses the <b>European Commission’s TSL list </b> as the basis of retrieving data of trusted certificates. The European Commission's TSL list is also referred to as List of Trusted Lists (LOTL), meaning that it is central list that contains references to other TSL lists, in this case the national TSL lists of the European Union's member states. Each of the member state's TSL list contains data (including the certificates) of the trust service providers that are approved in this particular country. Libdigidocpp supports <b>Finnish, Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian</b> national TSL lists. 

The supported TSL lists in Libdigidocpp can be downloaded from the following locations:
1. The European Commission's TSL: https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml
2. Finnish TSL: https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/attachments/TSL-Ficora.xml
3. Estonian TSL: http://sr.riik.ee/tsl/estonian-tsl.xml
4. Latvian TSL: http://www.dvi.gov.lv/en/wp-content/uploads/TSL/TSL-LV-6.xml
5. Lithuanian TSL: http://www.rrt.lt/failai/LT-TSL.xml

Note that TSL lists are supported since v3.9 of the library. The TSL support can be removed from  Libdigidocpp library by setting USE_TSL CMake build parameter value to "false". By default, the TSL support is enabled, meaning that trusted certificates are taken from trusted TSL lists. Also note that all trust services in supported TSLs are trusted regardless of their &lt;ServiceStatus&gt; value.



\subsubsection TSL-init TSL initialization process 

TSL lists' initialization process is done during each initialization of the library:
1. It is checked if LOTL (the master TSL list, tl-mp.xml) is present at the tsl.cache location 
	- If there is no such list present in the cache directory then it is downloaded from the list's URL (https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml) and saved to tsl.cache directory
	
	\note the TSL lists are not distributed along with the library's installation package, meaning that during the first initialization of the library, the TSL lists need to be downloaded online or must be manually copied to the tsl.cache location.
	
2. the LOTL is read in and validated:
	- the list's validity is checked in by comparing the user's computer time with the list's &lt;NextUpdate&gt; value. 
		- if the list is not valid then the library attempts to download a new list from the list's URL
	- the list's signature is validated by using its signing certificate
3. Finnish, Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian national TSLs' data (URLs and certificates) are read from the LOTL. 
4. For each of the national TSL list, the following is done:
	- step 1 of the current process is repeated with the national TSL list 
	- step 2 of the current process is repeated with the national TSL list
5. If the previously described process is successful, then the library reads in certificates from the national TSL lists and adds the certificates to the library's internal trusted certificates list.  


\subsection	tokens Identity tokens
Libdigidocpp library supports the following identity tokens:
- Estonian national eID card and Digi-ID

The library is also tested with the following tokens (indirectly via the DigiDoc3 Client desktop application that uses Libdigidocpp as a base component):
- Finnish national eID card
- Latvian national eID card
- Lithuanian national eID card
- Aladdin eToken USB authenticator with SK issued certificates for organizations











\section testing Interoperability testing
\subsection	Plugtests ASiC Remote Plugtests
The compliance of the BDOC 2.1 containers to \ref ASiC "ASiC" standard was successfully tested in the course of ASiC Remote Plugtests Event (19 November to 07 December 2012). The event aimed to ascertain the correctness and cross usability of ASiC-S and ASiC-E containers created by different participant organizations worldwide. The test cases included generation and cross-verification of ASiC containers with different features (including verification of incorrect files). Each participant chose the appropriate set of tests to be implemented.

The main BDOC 2.1 project coordinator, AS Sertifitseerimiskeskus (SK), participated in the ASiC Remote Plugtests event. The selected test cases were implemented with Libdigidocpp (C++) software library of DigiDoc system. Tests that were carried out by SK included functionality that was also applicable for BDOC 2.1 file format (\ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013"). Features that were tested included generation and cross-verification of ASiC-E containers with \ref XAdES "XAdES" signatures. The following test cases were covered:
- testing ASiC-E container structure,
- testing ASiC-E container’s syntactical conformance,
- testing correctness of XAdES-BES signature in ASiC-E container,
- negative tests of verifying ASiC-E container with invalid XAdES-BES signatures.
The implemented test cases did not cover generation and verification of signatures with time-marks or time-stamps (according to BDOC-TM and BDOC-TS profiles).
Results achieved by SK were as follows:
- test files that were generated by SK were successfully cross-verified by five different participants in 4 out of 6 implemented positive test cases (two of the test files were not verified by other participants). 
- SK successfully cross-verified files generated by other three participants in 5 out of 6 implemented positive test cases (one of the files could not be verified because of incompatibility with BDOC 2.1 standard). 
- SK successfully passed the negative test case which involved verification of incorrect test file.
Additional information about the ASiC Remote Plugtests event can be found from http://www.etsi.org/plugtests/ASiC/Home.htm. 

\subsection cross-usability DigiDoc framework cross-usability tests
Automated cross-usability tests of digitally signed and encrypted files are periodically carried out between different \ref DD-libs "DigiDoc software libraries":
- Cross-usability tests of digitally signed files in DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 format (.ddoc files) are carried out between JDigiDoc and CDigiDoc software libraries.
- Cross-usability of BDOC 2.1 (.bdoc or .asice) file format is tested between JDigiDoc and Libdigidocpp libraries.
- Cross-usability of encrypted file format CDOC 1.0 is carried out between JDigiDoc and CDigiDoc software libraries.
The interoperability tests are executed through the command line utility tools of the software libraries (for example, in case of Libdigidocpp library, the utility program which is described in chapter \ref utility of the current document).





\section implementation-notes Libdigidocpp implementation notes
The following section describes properties of a BDOC 2.1 file that are not strictly defined in the BDOC 2.1 specification \ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013" but are used in Libdigidocpp library’s implementation (and also in other DigiDoc software libraries) of the file format.


\subsection signature-notes Digital signature related notes
1.	The supported BDOC 2.1 signature profiles are BDOC-TM (XAdES-EPES signature with time-mark) and BDOC-TS (XAdES-BES signature with time-stamp and OCSP confirmation).
The basic BDOC-TM profile is XAdES-EPES as BDOC 2.1 specification requires that &lt;SignaturePolicyIdentifier&gt; element is present (\ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013", chap. 5.2). The basic BDOC-TS profile is XAdES-BES as the &lt;SignaturePolicyIdentifier&gt; element is not supported in case of BDOC 2.1 signatures with time-stamps.
It is expected that either a time-mark or time-stamp and OCSP confirmation have been added to the signature as according to BDOC 2.1 specification (\ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013", chap. 6) a signature is not considered complete or valid without validation data from external services (i.e. a time-mark or time-stamp). 
2.	Signatures with archive time-stamps are not supported, the functionality will be implemented in the future. 
3.	One time-mark is allowed for each signature in case of TM profile; one time-stamp and one OCSP confirmation are allowed for each signature in case of TS profile (due to security reasons and in order to maintain testing efficiency).
4.	In case of BDOC signature with time-mark, the OCSP confirmation's (i.e. time-mark's) nonce field’s value is calculated as follows: 
	-	the contents of &lt;SignatureValue&gt; element (i.e. the value without XML tags) is taken and decoded from base64 encoding;
	-	digest of the value found in the previous step is calculated by using SHA-256 algorithm.;
	-	the digest value found in the previous step and the digest algorithm that was used are transformed as defined by the following ASN.1 structure:
	\code{.cpp}
			TBSDocumentDigest ::= SEQUENCE {
				algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
				digest OCTET STRING
			}
	\endcode
	-	the ASN.1 block value produced in the previous step is included in the OCSP request’s “nonce” field and must be present in the respective field of the OCSP response.
5.	In case of signing with ECC keys (by using ECDSA algorithm), concatenation method is used for creating signature value.
6.	In case of BDOC 2.1 documents, SHA-256 hash function is used by default when calculating data file digests and the digest that is signed. In case of Estonian ID cards with certificates issued before 2011, the SHA-224 digest type will be automatically selected and used for calculating signature value’s digest (the final digest that is signed), other options are not supported here. Note that other digest in the signature (e.g. data file digests, signer certificate’s digest) are still calculated with SHA-256 (the default digest type). 
7.	When a hash function that is weaker than SHA-256 (or SHA-224 in the special case with pre-2011 ID-cards) has been used then a warning message about weak digest method is produced to the user. It is recommended to regard the error as a validation warning (identically to DigiDoc3. Client application and digidoc-tool.cpp utility program). 
8.	During signature creation, it is checked that there is only one &lt;ClaimedRole&gt; element in the signature, which contains the signer’s role and optionally the signer’s resolution. If the &lt;ClaimedRole&gt; element contains both role and resolution then they must be separated with a slash mark, e.g. “role / resolution”. Note that when setting the resolution value then role must also be specified. 
9.	The signature policy document’s hash value in &lt;SigPolicyHash&gt; element is checked during validation process (even though it is not mandatory according to BDOC 2.1 specification \ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013", chap. 5.2). The hash value must correspond to the hash value of the document that is located at https://www.sk.ee/repository/bdoc-spec20.pdf.
10.	&lt;Transforms&gt; element is not supported for security purposes and in order to maintain testing efficiency.
11.	XML namespace prefixes are used in case of all XML elements (e.g. “asic:”, “ds:”, “xades:”). 
12.	The data file’s MIME type that is used in case of Libdigidocpp’s utility program is always “application/octet-stream” for testing purposes.
13.	The <ds:Signature> element’s Id attribute value is set to “S<seq_no>” during signature creation where sequence numbers are counted from zero. Other Id values that are used in the sub-elements of the <ds:Signature> element contain the signature’s Id value as a prefix. During verification, different Id attribute values are also supported but are not tested periodically.
14. signatures*.xml file's XML structure validation is done on the basis of XAdES XML Schema (\ref XAdES), however, there are additional checks to determine any unsupported elements that are allowed by the XAdES specification but are not allowed by the BDOC 2.1 specification (\ref BDOC). The unsupported elements are CounterSignature, CompleteCertificateRefs, CompleteRevocationRefs, AttributeCertificateRefs, AttributeRevocationRefs, SigAndRefsTimeStamp, RefsOnlyTimeStamp, AttrAuthoritiesCertValues, AttributeRevocationValues, CommitmentTypeIndicationType, AllDataObjectsTimeStamp, IndividualDataObjectsTimeStampType. 
15. Special characters in URI attribute values are handled according to RFC3986 (since v3.9 of the library): the characters are percent-encoded, except of unreserved characters and delimiters. Both percent-encoded and non-percent-encoded characters are supported during signature's validation. Note that as a result, the files that contain special characters in URI values and have been created with v3.9 might not be compatible with v3.8 of the library.
16. When validating a BDOC-TS document then the difference between OCSP validity confirmation's production time (producedAt field) and time-stamp's production time (getTime field) is checked. An exception is thrown if the OCSP confirmation's time is earlier than time-stamp's time. If the OCSP confirmation's time is later than time-stamp's time by more than 15 minutes then a warning is returned. If the difference is more than 24 hours then exception is thrown. 
17. In case of BDOC-TS signature, the time-stamping authority's (TSA's) certificate is not added to the &lt;CertificateValues&gt; element (differently from the requirements of \ref BDOC specification, chap 6) to avoid duplication of the certificate in the signature. It is expected that the TSA certificate is present in the time-stamp token itself.

\subsection cert-notes Certificate related notes
1.	Valid signatures (qualified electronic signatures) can be created with a certificate that has “Non-repudiation” value (also referred to as “Content Commitment”) in its “Key usage” field. The requirement is based on the following sources:
	-	\ref nat-cert "ETSI TS 102 280 (V1.1.1)": “X.509 V3 Certificate Profile for Certificates Issued to Natural Persons”; chap. 5.4.3;
	-	Profile of certificates issued to private persons by AS Sertifitseerimiskeskus: “Certificates on identity card of Republic of Estonia”, version 3.3; appendix A.3.3 (see \ref sknatcert "ESTEID profile");
	-	Profile of certificates issued to legal entities by AS Sertifitseerimiskeskus: “Profile of institution certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists”, version 1.3; chap. 3.2.2 (see \ref skinstcert "Institution certificate profile").
2.	Signature can be created with a certificate that doesn’t have “Non-repudiation” value in its “Key-Usage” field when specific parameters have been set but validation of such signature will produce a respective error message and the signature is not considered as a qualified electronic signature.
3.	During signature validation, it is checked that the validity periods of the signer’s certificate and all the certificates in its CA chain include the signature creation time (value of the producedAt field in OCSP response).
	
\subsection container-notes Container related notes
1.	BDOC 2.1 files are created with .bdoc file extension. Extensions .asice and .sce are supported and recognized only when reading in an existing BDOC 2.1 file which has the respective extension value.
2.	Signatures are stored in META-INF/signatures*.xml files where ‘*’ is a sequence number, counting is started from zero. 
3.	There can be only one signature in one signatures*.xml file due to BDOC format’s legacy issues. Multiple signatures in one signatures*.xml file is not supported in order to maintain testing efficiency. The <ds:Signature> element’s Id attribute values in different signatures*.xml files are generated in the form of “S<seq_no>”, the sequence numbers are always unique within one BDOC container.
4.	It is not allowed to add two data files with the same name to the container as the signed data file must be uniquely identifiable in the container.
5.	All data files in the container must be signed. All signatures in the container must sign all of the data files.
6.	The META-INF/manifest.xml file’s version attribute value is “1.0” (instead of “1.2”) as the results of ASiC plug-tests event shows that version 1.0 is used only. The requirement of the OpenDocument version attribute value comes from \ref OpenDocument "OpenDocument standard" which is referred to in \ref ASiC "ASiC standard".
7.	Relative file paths are used, for example “META-INF/signatures*.xml” and “document.txt” instead of “/META-INF/signatures*.xml” and “/document.txt” to ensure better interoperability with third party applications when validating signatures.
8.	The ZIP container’s comment field contains version number of the library that was used for creating the file. The value can be useful, for example, when trying to determine the origin of an erroneous file. 
9.	“mimetype" file is not compressed in the BDOC 2.1 file’s ZIP container as the results of ASiC plug-tests event shows that this solution is most widely used.
10.	When a data file is added to the container then the modification time of the file (as it is registered in the file system) is preserved also in the ZIP container file. There is an exception if the file is added by reading it from an input stream - in that case, the current timestamp value is registered as “last modified” time in the ZIP file.
